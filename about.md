Hi, I am James Meneghello, a PhD Candidate at Murdoch University in Perth, Australia.
I graduated from Murdoch University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Internet Software Development, before co-founding a web development firm. I later completed my Master of Science in Information Technology at Murdoch, and was awarded an Australian Postgraduate Award to complete a PhD in Data Mining.

I am currently working on social data mining and analytics as part of my PhD, specialising in Social Data Extraction.

In my spare time, I also work on open-source projects such as [Pynab][pynab], a Usenet Indexer written in Python.
